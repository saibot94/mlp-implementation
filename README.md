## Data Mining - Multilayer perceptron implementation

### Introduction

This is the project implementing the multilayer perceptron algorithm for data mining, spring semester 2017, AIDC I, West University of Timisoara.

In order to see the main implementation's details and benchmarks, see the `report pdf` file.

### Running

In order to run the Python version, you just write some code that connects to the pymlp package. The dependencies for the python version can be found in the pymlp file: `requirements.txt`

The scala code needs `sbt` to be installed. You can run the tests in order to see that the implementation is working.
